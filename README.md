# dynamic_risk_assessment_system
This is a "fork" of the project "build a dynamic risk assessment system" in the Udactiy nanodegree ML DevOps. 

# Environment setup
I chose to create my own environment with conda and install the requirements.txt with pip instead of using the workspace. This way, I can work in vscode and have full control over the dev env:

```
conda create -n risk_assessment python=3.7.6
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
